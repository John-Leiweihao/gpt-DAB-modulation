The following content is only a supplement to the rationale for the chosen modulation strategy.

Single Phase Shift (SPS):
Advantages:
Simple structure and easy control strategy.
High efficiency at low power transfer levels.
Suitable for applications with limited control complexity.


Extended Phase Shift (EPS):
Advantages:
Maintains high efficiency over a wide range of load conditions.
Improved voltage utilization compared to SPS, allowing for smaller transformer and switch ratings.
Better suited for applications with variable load conditions.


Dual Phase Shift (DPS):
Advantages:
Further improvement in voltage utilization and conversion efficiency.
Reduction in the size and cost of transformer and switching devices.
Suitable for high-power applications where efficiency is critical.

Triple Phase Shift (TPS):
Advantages:
Even higher voltage utilization and efficiency compared to DPS.
Reduced size and cost of passive components such as transformers and filters.
Enhanced flexibility in controlling power flow and managing circulating energy.


Five-Degree Phase Shift:
Advantages:
Offers the highest level of flexibility and optimization potential for efficiency.
Capable of adapting to a wide range of load conditions and input voltages.
Optimal for applications where maximum efficiency and performance are required.
