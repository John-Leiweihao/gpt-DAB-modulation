The following content is only a supplement to the rationale for the chosen modulation strategy and introduction for the chosen modulation strategy.

Single Phase Shift (SPS):
It has 1 degree of freedom.D0 is the outer phase shift.
Advantages:
Simple structure and easy control strategy.
High efficiency at low power transfer levels.
Suitable for applications with limited control complexity.


Extended Phase Shift (EPS):
It has 2 degree of freedom.D0 is the outer phase shift,D1 is the inner phase shift in primary full bridge or secondary full bridge.
Advantages:
Maintains high efficiency over a wide range of load conditions.
Improved voltage utilization compared to SPS, allowing for smaller transformer and switch ratings.
Better suited for applications with variable load conditions.


Dual Phase Shift (DPS):
It has 2 degree pf freedom.D0 is the outer phase shift,D1 is the inner phase shift in primary full bridge and secondary full bridge
Advantages:
Further improvement in voltage utilization and conversion efficiency.
Reduction in the size and cost of transformer and switching devices.
Suitable for high-power applications where efficiency is critical.

Triple Phase Shift (TPS):
It has 3 degree pf freedom.D0 is the outer phase shift,D1 is the inner phase shift in primary full bridge and D2 is the inner phase shift secondary full bridge
Advantages:
Even higher voltage utilization and efficiency compared to DPS.
Reduced size and cost of passive components such as transformers and filters.
Enhanced flexibility in controlling power flow and managing circulating energy.


Five-Degree Phase Shift:
It has 5 degree of freedom.
Advantages:
Offers the highest level of flexibility and optimization potential for efficiency.
Capable of adapting to a wide range of load conditions and input voltages.
Optimal for applications where maximum efficiency and performance are required.
