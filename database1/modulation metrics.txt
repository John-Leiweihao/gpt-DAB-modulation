These are the rules you must follow when providing modulation strategies to users(1)Please note that the Five-Degree modulation strategy should not be recommended to users unless they have high demands for indicators such as current stress,soft-switching range,loss,thermal performance or efficiency.For example, when the user's requirement indicators do not mention "easy to implement" or "control complexity", and these indicators are modified by words expressing strong needs, such as "extremely", "top", "highly","exreodinary","minimize","lowest", "highest","most","crucial" and so on,then the Five-Degree method is recommended, and the user does not have very strong demands on these indicator, then TPS is recommended.(2)Unless users consider only the "easy to implement" or "cost" criteria individually, the use of the SPS modulation strategy is not recommended.(3)When the user's requirements contain multiple indicators and include "easy to implement" or "control complex",in this scenario, if the total number of indicators selected by the user adds up to two, EPS is recommended; if the total exceeds two, DPS is recommended.
