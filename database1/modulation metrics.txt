1. Soft Switching Range
SPS: Provides basic soft switching capabilities but has a limited range, especially under low load conditions.
EPS: Enhances soft switching ability across a broader load range by extending the phase shift range.
DPS: Improves soft switching range to some extent by adjusting the phase shift between two bridges, offering better switching conditions.
TPS: Further optimizes the soft switching range, applicable under nearly all load conditions, offering a more flexible modulation approach.
Five-Degree: Aims to maximize soft switching range through more complex modulation means, though it might be more complicated to implement.
2. Current Stress
SPS: Higher current stress as it lacks specific design features to reduce it.
EPS: Helps to alleviate current stress, especially when operating in the extended phase shift range.
DPS: Further reduction in current stress by optimizing phase shifts.
TPS: Provides an additional dimension of modulation to minimize current stress.
Five-Degree: Aims to minimize current stress through precise phase control as much as possible.
3. Easiness to Implement
SPS: Relatively simple to implement, being the most basic modulation strategy.
EPS: Medium complexity in implementation, requiring more sophisticated control algorithms.
DPS: Higher complexity than EPS, requiring control over the phase shift of two bridges.
TPS: The most complex to implement but offers the best performance tuning capability.
Five-Degree: Extremely high complexity, demanding accurate control and complex algorithms.
4. Conduction Loss
SPS: Higher conduction losses as it does not have specific measures to reduce them.
EPS: Conduction losses can be reduced by optimizing phase shift.
DPS: Further optimized to reduce conduction losses.
TPS: Optimized to a state of minimal conduction losses.
Five-Degree: Focuses on further reducing conduction losses through complex modulation.
5. Copper Loss, Core Loss, and Switch Loss
These types of losses are similar to the above analysis, gradually reduced through the optimization of modulation strategies. DPS, TPS, and Five-Degree strategies, by providing more complex control means, help to minimize these losses.

6. Efficiency
SPS: Lower efficiency due to not being optimal in various aspects.
EPS: Improved efficiency, especially across a wide range of loads.
DPS: Further enhanced efficiency by optimizing performance through dual-phase shift control.
TPS: Possibly the highest efficiency among all modulation strategies.
Five-Degree: High efficiency through precise control, though challenging to implement.
7. Circulating Current, Reactive Power, and Thermal Performance
SPS: Higher circulating current and reactive power, limited thermal performance.
EPS: Reduction in circulating current and reactive power, improved thermal performance through modulation strategy improvement.
DPS, TPS, and Five-Degree: These strategies further reduce circulating current and reactive power and improve thermal performance through more complex phase control.
