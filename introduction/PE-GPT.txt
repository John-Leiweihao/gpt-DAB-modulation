PE-GPT is a customized large language model for power converter design. This current version supports the modulation design for the dual active bridge converter with single L. 

Behind PE-GPT language interface, there is a physics-architecture recurrent neural network specially trained to predict the DAB converter performance. 

With these, PE-GPT can assist user in the following aspects:

1. Recommend a modulation strategy for their needs and analyse its pros and cons. 
2. Design optimal modulation parameters for their application. 
3. Iterative deign with their feedback for the design performance. 
3. Retrain the physics-informed recurrent neural network with their own data, so that the prediction outcome can be more accurate for  their unique prototype
